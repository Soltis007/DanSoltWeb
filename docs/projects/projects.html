            <h1>HackTheBox</h1>
            <p>In my pursuit of a career in cyber, I have taken it upon myself to learn on my own as much as I can. My HackTheBox account will be listed below. While I am still a beginner as far as penetration testing goes, I believe tring to complete at least one box a week on my own has helped develop my skillset. As it stands, the boxes I have completed thus far are beginner level and I have focused on machines where I can utilize my knowledge of python in order to get better at scripting. Some of the concepts learned are :</p>
            <strong>Reconnaissance Scripting</strong>
            <p> With pythons "socket" and "nmap" library</p>
            <strong>Basic Password Cracking</strong>
            <p>Using "hashlib" and "itertools"</p>
            <strong>Web Exploitation</strong>
            
            </div>
