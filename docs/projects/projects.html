                <h2>Home Lab Environment</h2>
                <p> In setting up my home lab, I chose to run a Kali Linux virtual machine on VMware Fusion, tailored for my Mac’s ARM64 architecture. This setup has been a practical way to sharpen my skills with Linux systems, especially in managing virtual machines and configuring network settings. I faced a few initial hurdles, particularly in getting Kali Linux to work smoothly with VMware Fusion on an unconventional architecture. This process taught me a lot about system dependencies and the intricacies of virtualization technology. One key aspect was learning how to allocate sufficient RAM and CPU resources to optimize performance without overtaxing my host system. This hands-on experience has been invaluable, enhancing my ability to troubleshoot and fine-tune the security tools I use regularly on HackTheBox.

            <h1>HackTheBox</h1>
            
            <p>In my pursuit of a career in cyber, I have taken it upon myself to learn on my own as much as I can. My HackTheBox account will be listed below. While I am still a beginner as far as penetration testing goes, I believe trying to complete at least one box a week on my own has helped develop my skillset. As it stands, the boxes I have completed thus far are beginner level and I have focused on machines where I can utilize my knowledge of python in order to get better at scripting. Some of the concepts learned are :</p>
            <strong>Reconnaissance Scripting</strong>
            <p> With pythons "socket" and "nmap" library</p>
            <strong>Basic Password Cracking</strong>
            <p>Using "hashlib" and "itertools"</p>
            <strong>Web Exploitation</strong>
            <p>"requests" and "sqlmap" for sql injections, XSS reverse shell remote code execution. Hands on with Burpsuite.</p>
            <strong>Log Analysis</strong>
            <p>Monitoring network, web server, and application logs for potential exploitation. "Wireshark", "tcpdump", amd "nmap" for network mapping</p>

            <h2>HackerRank</h2>
            <p> I've been diving deep into programming challenges on HackerRank to sharpen my coding skills, especially in Python. Tackling everything from simple data problems to complex algorithms has really helped me think more like a programmer and improve my problem-solving abilities. My journey through HackerRank's varied challenges has earned me a Python proficiency badge, marking my growth and dedication to mastering code. These experiences have not only boosted my technical skills but also built a portfolio that showcases my coding journey and my commitment to continuous learning.</p>

            <h2>Work In Progress</h2>
            <p> Finally, this website portfolio has been quite the project of its own. I took it upon myself to create this, in the event someone will notice my hardwork and desire to be in the field of cyber. Through many failures, I have devloped the skill to not give up. Instead, I have started the journey of becoming undeniable. While I am still a beginner, with my self-study and determination I have developed my own projects and created a collection of work across various sites. This on top of my hard-earned certifications makes me a qualified candidate for the field, and I look forward to showing my grit when I earn an opportunity.
