                <h2>Background on myself</h2>
                <p>
    I am a proud graduate of the University of Maryland, College Park, where I earned a <span class="bold">Bachelor of Science degree in Information Science </span> in May 2023. Throughout my academic journey, I immersed myself in a diverse curriculum that covered areas such as <span class="bold">Tech Infrastructure</span>, <span class="bold">Network Architecture</span>, and <span class="bold">Database Design and Modeling</span>, complementing my studies with courses in <span class="bold">Privacy, Security, and Ethics in Big Data</span>. My time at the university not only sharpened my technical skills but also honed my analytical abilities, preparing me to tackle complex challenges in the IT and cybersecurity fields. I consistently achieved academic excellence, as evidenced by making the Deanâ€™s List twice during my tenure.
