                <h2>Background on myself</h2>
                <p>I am a proud graduate of the University of Maryland, College Park, where I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Science in May 2023. Throughout my academic journey, I immersed myself in a diverse curriculum that covered areas such as Tech Infrastructure, Network Architecture, and Database Design and Modeling, complementing my studies with courses in Privacy, Security, and Ethics in Big Data. My time at the university not only sharpened my technical skills but also honed my analytical abilities, preparing me to tackle complex challenges in the IT and cybersecurity fields. I consistently achieved academic excellence, as evidenced by making the Deanâ€™s List twice during my tenure.
