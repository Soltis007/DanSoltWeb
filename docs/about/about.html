            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I’m a proud graduate of the<span class="bold">University of Maryland, College Park, </span>where I earned my <span class="bold">B.Sc in Information Science </span>in 2023. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of gaining hands-on experience in IT support, network management, and cybersecurity. Currently, I’m working as an IT Support Specialist at Bolton Partners, where I provide help desk support, manage Active Directory, and troubleshoot network issues. My previous role at Cybrary helped solidify my skills in overall cybersecurity concepts and best practices, managing helpdesk tickets, and getting to work under/learn frome some of the greatest minds in the industry.

            I hold certifications in both <span class="bold">CompTIA Security+ and CCNA </span>, and I’m continually looking for opportunities to grow my skills, especially in the fields of network engineering and cybersecurity. My goal is to build a career that bridges both technical expertise and creative problem-solving, always pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in technology.

            When I’m not immersed in the world of IT, you can find me at the gym, hanging out with my dog, or enjoying a good book. I am really into books that teach technical concepts as I believe it helps to learn on your own.</p>
