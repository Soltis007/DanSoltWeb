                <p> I graduated with a <span class="bold">B.Sc in Information Science from the University of Maryland, College Park, completing my degree in just three years</span>—a testament to my dedication and ability to thrive under pressure. My curriculum was rich with a variety of foundational and advanced topics, from <span class="bold">Network Architecture and Database Design to the critical aspects of Big Data ethics.</span> Additionally,<span class="bold"> my coursework in Privacy, Security, and Ethics in Big Data </span>further solidified my understanding of the security challenges and ethical considerations in today’s digital landscape. I also deepened my technical toolkit through courses in <span class="bold">Dynamic Web Applications and Object-Oriented Programming</span>, which have been crucial in honing my coding and software development skills. By applying these principles in real-world projects, I've been able to effectively bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical application.</p>

This role was crucial in obtaining my Security +. Transitioning into the contract role, I took on more responsibility, <span class="bold"> managing help desk tickets for the site and collaborating with cross-functional teams to optimize our systems </span>.
