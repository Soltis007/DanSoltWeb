                <h2>Intern to IT Helpdesk 1 | Cybrary | Nov 2022 – Apr 2024</h2>
                <p>
    At Cybrary, I had the opportunity to grow from an IT intern into a full-fledged IT Support role. As an intern, I gained foundational experience by <span class="bold"> assisting with daily IT tasks, monitoring network performance, and learning how to efficiently resolve technical issues.</span> Transitioning into the IT Support position, I took on more responsibility, <span class="bold"> managing help desk tickets, performing routine network checks, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to optimize IT systems </span>. Using tools like Atlassian ServiceDesk, I ensured smooth operations across the organization while resolving technical issues in a timely manner. My time at Cybrary strengthened my troubleshooting skills, enhanced my ability to work in a fast-paced environment, and developed my expertise in maintaining and improving network reliability.
